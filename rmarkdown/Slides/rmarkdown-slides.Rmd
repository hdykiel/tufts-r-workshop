# Goals for today

* Understand what the rmarkdown package is and what you can build with it
* Learn the basics of a RMD document so you can use it to do analysis and/or build reproducible reports
* Learn how you can use RSC in conjunction with RMD reports to communicate your findings and reach more people
* Learn how to create a dynamic dashboard with RMD with flexdashboard


# Agenda 

* Intro 
* Basics of RMD
* Deploying RMD to RStudio Connect 
* Building a flexdashboard 
* Bonus round and/or practice session 

# How it works
 

When you run render, R Markdown feeds the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the code and itâ€™s output.

The markdown file generated by knitr is then processed by pandoc which is responsible for creating the finished format.

This may sound complicated, but R Markdown makes it extremely simple by encapsulating all of the above processing into a single  render function.

# Why is it useful? 

Repdroducible analyses $\Longrightarrow$ increased efficiency, reduced error rate

- Share results with stakeholders who don't care about the code 
- Share results & analysis with other data practitioners

# What can I build with the rmarkdown package? 

- Static reports in various formarts including [html](http://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/content/1129/report.html){target="_blank"}, [PDF](http://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/content/1081/parameterized-happiness.pdf){target="_blank"}, Word, and Powerpoint. 
- Websites. The [rmarkdown website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/){target="_blank"} itself is built using rmarkdown
