```{r setup}
library(reticulate)
```


In addition to R, RStudio can be used to execute other code such as SQL, Bash, and Python.

```{r r-data}
# load data
df <- mtcars # save to R object
```

Access R objects from python.
```{python py-data}
import pandas
cars = r.df
cars = cars[cars['mpg'] <= 20]
print(cars.head())
```

Persistent python objects across code chunks.
```{python py-filter}
filtered_cars = cars[cars['cyl'] != 4]
print(filtered_cars.head())
```


Plotting in python
```{python py-plot}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

filtered_cars.plot.scatter(x='disp', y = 'hp')
```

Plotting in R
```{r r-plot}
library(ggplot2)
py_data <- py$filtered_cars
ggplot(py_data, aes(x = disp, y = hp)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
py$cars
```
