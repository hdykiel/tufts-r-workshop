1. install and load the `nycflights13` package which contains all 336,776 flights which departed from New York City in 2013.

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
head(flights)
```


2. Find all flights that had an arrival delay of 2 or more hours
```{r}
flights %>% filter(dep_delay >= 2)
```

3. Find all flights which were operated by United, American, or Delta

```{r}
unique(flights$carrier)
flights %>% filter(carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))

```

4. Another useful **dplyr** filtering helper is `between()`. Can you use it to find all flights which departed between January and April?

```{r}
flights %>% filter(between(month, 1, 4))
```

5. Calculate the average delay time for each airline
```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(mean.delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T))
```
