**5 key dplyr verbs**
1. filter: pick observation by their values
2. arrange: reorder rows
3. select: pick variables by their names
4. mutate: create new variables with functions of existing variables
5. summarize: collapse many values down to a single summary

**Examples**

```{r}
# load necessary packages
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)
  
# print first observations of dataframe
head(mtcars)

# filter cars with good MPG
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20)
mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20)

# are these equivalent to the same thing?
filter(mtcars, mpg > 20) == mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20)
identical(filter(mtcars, mpg > 20),
          mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 20))


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
